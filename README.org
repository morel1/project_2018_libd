* Background
** [[https://www.nimh.nih.gov/health/topics/schizophrenia/index.shtml][Schizophrenia]] (Hyperlink to NIH-NIMH)
1. Mental disorder that affects persons thoughts, feelings, and behaviors
   - Altered Perception
   - Reduced expressive function
   - Range of reduced cognitive function
   - No cure, but various treatments/therapies
     - Antipsychotics
     - Psycosocial
     - Specialty care 
2. Types of risk
   - Environment
     - Poverty
     - [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1547920/pdf/bmjcred00554-0006.pdf][Psychosocial]] (An article expanding on this)
   - Brain chemistry/structure
     - Developmental issues that affect brain function and neurotransmitters
   - Genetic
     - Evidence due to heritability
     - [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4112379/][Genetic risk varients]] (Hyperlink to a meta-analysis - will be focus)
** [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18824075][Caudate Nucleus]] (Hyperlink to a review)
1. Part of basal ganglia
   - Basal ganglia associated with motor function
   - Can be further broken down into nuclei of activity
   - Caudate nuclues is part of the striatum of the basal ganglia
2. Function
   - Input nuclei to basal ganglia
     - From dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
     - Involved in sensory motor loop and recieves input from primary and supplementary motor areas
   - Lesions in caudate affected:
     - delayed response, inhibitry control
     - behavior
     - visual discrimination learning, reversal learning
     - switch between response-based and visual cue-based approaches
   - [[http://www.jneurosci.org/content/25/11/2941][Article]] on Caudate nucleus and leanrning
** Importance non-coding RNAs in Schizophrenia
1. Non coding RNA (ncRNA)
   - Does not have potential coding function
   - There are a few types of [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3096308/][ncRNAs in ekaryotes have different regulatory roles (Review on cardiovascular tissue, but good ncRNA descriptions)]]
   - Shown to affect [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3478095/][brain development and disease]]
   - May be [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4120821/][region and cell specific]]
   - Focus - long noncoding RNA (lncRNA)
     - >200 bases
     - [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3583990/][Some regulatory roles]]
     - [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4120821/][Roles in cell fate]]
2. Genetic Component to Schizophrenia
   - Schizophrnia is complex and polygenic
   - ncRNAs have been found to to affect [[https://www.nature.com/articles/s41398-017-0030-5]['pathogenisis of disease']] for Schizophrenia
   - lncRNAs have been found to be [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4588008/][associated with Schizophrenia]]
** GDNF-AS1
1. Basic information
   - Named after GDNF
   - helps dopamine neuron survival
   - Associated with a variety of [[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3247946/][neurodegenerative diseases]]
     - effective therapy for lab models of Parkison's disease
     - 
* Methods
** What samples are we going to use?
*** (golden) Find PE, stranded, caudate nucleus, control
1. [[http://useast.ensembl.org/Homo_sapiens/Gene/Summary?g=ENSG00000248587;r=5:37811589-37953827][Human: Chromosome 5: 37,811,589-37,953,827 forward strand]]
   - 5 splice varients
   - Using GRCh38.p12
*** Brain region specific
*** Neuron cell types
*** Tested
